You’ll be joining an active project — our current developer will provide full training and walkthroughs of the system to ensure a smooth transition and quick onboarding.

Perform bug testing and fixes to ensure a stable, high-performance product.

Optimize database performance and security using PostgreSQL.

Collaborate closely with the team to ensure smooth handoff and consistent progress.

Provide clear documentation of updates, fixes, and changes.


Requirements:

Proven experience as a Full-Stack Developer with React and Node.js.

Strong proficiency in TypeScript and PostgreSQL.

Experience with event, booking, or registration systems (preferred).

Skilled in debugging, testing, and optimizing both front-end and back-end components.

Familiarity with REST APIs, Git, and modern deployment workflows.

Excellent communication skills and ability to work independently.


Nice to Have:

Experience integrating payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).

Familiarity with AWS or similar cloud environments.

Understanding of UI/UX best practices.


What We Offer:

Direct training and system handoff from the current developer.

Flexible hours and remote work environment.

Clearly defined milestones and deliverables.

Opportunity for ongoing or long-term collaboration after successful completion.

To Apply:

Please include:

A brief overview of your relevant experience, especially in event or booking systems.

Links or examples of similar projects you’ve completed.

Your availability and preferred hourly rate or milestone pricing.
